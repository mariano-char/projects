### 🎮 Pokémon Console App (Python, API)

Developed a Python-based console application that interacts with the PokeAPI to retrieve real time data on various Pokémon and berries. The application combines core Pokémon concepts with custom game logic, storing user choices, outcomes, and bonus attributes such as Pokémon mood and trainer level in a text file. This project demonstrates beginner level API integration, data handling, and creative problem solving using Python.

### 🩸 Blood Product Orders Database (SQL)

Designed and managed a SQL database to track blood product orders for patients. The system stores patient data including haemoglobin levels, calculates the required number of blood units for transfusions, and ensures units meet volume and protocol requirements. It also tracks delivery times and monitors stock levels to support effective inventory management.

### 💸 Monthly Expense Tracker (Python, MySQL)

Built a Python based API connected to a MySQL database to manage monthly expense records. The system supports inserting, updating, and retrieving expense data, as well as viewing spending summaries and current savings. This project highlights practical experience working with databases and backend logic.

### 🥇 Group Project: Employee Skills Tracker (API, Data Analysis)

Collaborated on a group project that uses an API to access employee data and match individual skills against job role requirements. The application calculates a match score and identifies skill gaps, helping managers understand development priorities. This project strengthened my experience with APIs, data analysis, and teamwork.
